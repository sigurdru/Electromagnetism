Consider the scenario in figure \ref{fig:figure}. In this exercise we are going to discuss what happens to the magnet when the current runs through the solenoid.

Considering the scenario in figure \ref{fig:figure}, what happens to the magnet when the current is running through the solenoid?
!bsolution
Using the right hand rule the solenoid will create a north pole above it, repelling the magnet (the magnet is forced upward).

!bsubex
Lets say we short the circuit so there is no current going through the solenoid, what happens to the magnet?
!bsolution
If there is no current through the solenoid there wont be any magnetic force acting on the magnet, therefore it will lower a bit until the gravitational force and the force from the spring are in equilibrium.

!bsubex
Describe what happens if the current changes direction, what happens to the magnet then?
!bsolution
Again using the right hand rule, the solenoid will create a south pole above it, and this time attracting the magnet.

!bsubex
Is there any way to make the magnet oscillate up and down?
!bsolution
Use AC instead of DC.
