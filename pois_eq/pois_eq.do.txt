In this exesrcise we will look at Poisson's Equation.
!bsubex
Using Gauss' Law, derive Poisson's Equation.
!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 V = -\frac{\rho _v}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}

Gauss' Law on differential form:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho _v \implies \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho _v}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
!et
We can then apply the relationship $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V$, giving:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \nabla V= \nabla^2V = -\frac{\rho_ v}{\epsilon} 
\end{equation}

Consider a sylinder with height $h=1\rm{m}$ and radius $r=1\rm{m}$. The inside of the sylinder is hollow, and the walls are very thin. Use Poisson's Equation to find the electric potential on the walls of the sylinder. The bottom of the sylinder has electric potential $V=10\rm{V}$, and the top of the sylinder has zero potential. The sylinder is electrically neutral.
!bhint
If you fold the sylinder out you get a square.
!ehint
!bsolution
Since the bottom and top of the sylinder has a constant potential, we know that the potential is only a function of height. We also know that $\rho _v = 0$, which gives:
!bt
\begin{align}
\nabla² V = \frac{d²V}{dh²} = 0 \implies V(h) = Ah + B 
\end{align}
!et
Using boundary conditions we get the solution $V(h) = (-10 \rm{V/m}) h + 10\rm{V}$.

!bsubex
Find a difference equation that approximates the solution Poisson's Equation, in one dimension.
!bhint
Use the approximation
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{dV_n}{dx} \approx \frac{V_{n+1}-V_n}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
!et
!ehint
!bsolution
Using the hint we get that
!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d² V_n}{d x²} &\approx \frac{1}{\Delta x}\bigg(\frac{V_{n+1} - V_n}{\Delta x} - \frac{V_{n+2} - V{n+1}}{\Delta x}\bigg) \\
&= \frac{V_{n+2}- 2V_{n+1} + V_n}{\Delta x²} = -\frac{\rho _v}{\epsilon} \\
\implies V_{n+2} &= 2V_{n+1} - V_n - \frac{\rho _v}{\epsilon}\Delta x²
\end{align}

Imagine that we dont know the theoretical solution. We then need to find it numerically. Use the difference equation over to solve Poisson's Equation numerically for the sylinder.
!bhint
Notice that you only know the top and bottom condition. You need to test for differen initial conditions until you find a solution that fits.
!ehint
!bhint
To test the initial conditions, you need to compare your result (with the tested initial conditions) with the potential at the bottom of the sylinder (that you know).
!ehint
!bhint
A good testing range is $V_{n+1} \in [10\rm{V}, 8\rm{V}]$.
